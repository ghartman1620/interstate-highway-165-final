        <h1>Growth of Interstate Highway System Brings Reduced Traffic Deaths and Growing Cities</h1>

<!--
        <p> The Interstate Highway Act, passed in 1956, created a 41,000-mile highway system across the United States aiming to connect the states and provide a safe, effective, personal, and affordable means of transpotation for citizens.</p>
        <p> Construction of the highway continued over the decades since, with a 2000 mile addition being passed as recently as 1997.</p>
        <p> This construction was fragmented and parts of the highway were completed before others. As the highway grew, how did it affect the lives of Americans living in the places with highway growth? Were they more prosperous? Did their commute times change? Can we show a meaningful link between the construction of parts of the system and meaningful variables in areas it was built?</p>

        <h2> Purpose </h2>
        
        <p> In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Interstate Highway Act, fundind a 41,000-mile network of highways across the United States. This has been called one of the best investments a nation ever made. The amount of money spent on the interstate highway system was returned in safety, economic gains, and improved quality of life for Americans. I want to show that federally funded investments to public infrastructure such as the Interstate Highway System can be cost effective and yield useful returns for the nation.</p>
