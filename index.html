        <h1>Interstate Highway System Growth in the U.S.</h1>
        <p class="center">Gabriel Hartman ghartman@ucsc.edu</p>
        <p> The Interstate Highway Act, passed in 1956, created a 41,000-mile highway system across the United States aiming to connect the states and provide a safe, effective, personal, and affordable means of transpotation for citizens.</p>
        <p> Construction of the highway continued over the decades since, with a 2000 mile addition being passed as recently as 1997.</p>
        <p> This construction was fragmented and parts of the highway were completed before others. As the highway grew, how did it affect the lives of Americans living in the places with highway growth? Were they more prosperous? Did their commute times change? Can we show a meaningful link between the construction of parts of the system and meaningful variables in areas it was built?</p>
        
        <h2> Data Sources </h2>
        
        <p> The <a href="fhwa.dot.gov">Federal Highway Administration</a> has a wealth of knowledge on the Interstate Highway System and other transportation infrastructure in the United States. Of particular interest is an <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/data/page01.cfm">article describing the locations and completion dates of particular parts of the system.</a></p>
        
        <p> The U.S. Geological Survey provides data on the <a href="https://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/transportation/MapServer">current state of various transportation infrastructure</a>, including highways, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Forest Service.
        </p>
        
        <p> The U.S. Census publishes information about historical censuses it has conducted. It includes a few reports on historical <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting/data.html">commute data.</a> It includes records of data on <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/commuting/tables/time-series/journey/mode6790.txt">how Americans commuted to work from 1960-1990</a> and other information.
