        <div class="description">
        <p> In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Interstate Highway Act, funding a 41,000-mile network of highways across the United States. This has been called one of the best investments a nation ever made. The Interstate Highway System is a safer network of roads than others in our nation's highway system. Construction of the Interstate Highway System and other road safety improvements cause less traffic fatalities to occur for each vehicle mile travelled (VMT).</p>
        <p > The example of the Interstate Highway System shows that large national infrastructure projects can be effective and feasible but take time and investment to yield results.</p>

            <p> * Other highways include other highways in the National Highway System, other Federal Aid Highways, and non-Federal Aid Highways.</li>
            <p> ** Deaths mitigated for a year computed by supposing the miles that were driven on interstates on any given year would instead be driven on other highway systems if no interstate highway system existed and computing the number of fatalities that would have occured were those miles driven at the fatality rate of other highways. </li>
