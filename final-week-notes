Questions

1. I imagine highway extent interactivity right now shows highways that are in progress and highways that are complete on the map for the year. What color
should be used to distinguish between them?

2. Where should the highway description tooltip go?

3. Is it worth my time to try to do budget? If so, stacked bar or sankey diagram?

4. Should I go acquire more recent data (the relevant publication publishes up to 2016, but these years were all in one place very conveniently)? Is it higher priority than #3?

5. Layout? If I add another viz for budget (either sankey or stacked) what should layout be?

tooltips - increase line spacing (css line spacing)
d3 format the numbers to use commas

highlighted color - use something bright

ask professor:
position of slider
color
layout
if haven't done fourth yet on budget, is it necessary? layout on it? 
tooltip - why it's difficult to do tooltip on map, is the tooltip on scatterplot sufficient?
ask if more recent data (it exists) is required
